A movie recommendation program 

1. Define the nodes: In a movie recommendation system, the nodes can represent movies or users. We can create a set of nodes for each of these entities.

2. Define the edges: 
   * In a weighted directed graph, the edges can represent the similarity between two movies or two users. We can use a similarity metric like cosine similarity or Euclidean distance to calculate the edge weights. 
   * In a bipartite graph, the edges can represent the ratings given by users to movies. We can assign edge weights based on the ratings given by users.

3. Build the graph: We can use a graph library like NetworkX to create the graph and add nodes and edges to it.

4. Implement a recommendation algorithm: We can use an algorithm like collaborative filtering or content-based filtering to recommend movies to users based on the graph structure.
